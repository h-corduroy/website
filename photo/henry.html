    <h1>Henny Time</h1>

    <p>6/14/2023</p>
    <p>Henry came to visit me in New York. He was supposed to come up two weeks ago, but I took an impulsive trip to San
        Francisco and didn’t get back until yesterday. Thankfully he had a couple days off work before I jetted back to
        North Carolina. I don’t know the next time I’ll be up in the North East to visit him.</p>
    <p>I got off work around noon and we hit the park. Henry brought his bike, but I’m living out of my backpack,
        unfortunately. So I was stuck on the Citi Bike. I’m usually the one with the bike, feeling like everyone else is
        moving so slow. I guess this gives me a bit of sympathy for everyone who chooses to go places on two feet. We
        stopped by a dispensary before going to the park. The man at the counter had an accent. He said, “you know what
        we call those bikes?” We did know. “A one-to-one speed.” That’s not what it’s called. It’s called a fixed gear.

    <p> We sat on a bench in prospect park and watched some people having an argument from a little ways away. We couldn’t tell what they were saying, but we thought we could tell what was happening. There was a father with two kids who were playing on a tree. The tree was small and they were dangling from the branches. A cyclist stopped and spoke angrily to the father. We thought they were arguing about the tree. The tree was too small and weak to support the kids playing on the branches. It could hurt the tree. They interacted for a bit and then the cyclist left. The kids kept playing on the branch, perhaps even more violently than before. A few moments later a cop walked up and said something to the father. They spoke for a minute. The kids kept playing on the tree. This made me think we had it all wrong. Maybe the tree was irrelevant, there was some completely separate issue. Or maybe the cop just didn’t give a fuck and wanted it to look like he was doing something. Probably the ladder? </p>

    <p>We went to the zoo, but I don’t support zoos and didn’t want to buy a ticket. We left.

    <p>For dinner we decided to make some stir-fry with vermicelli. I’ve been stoked on vermicelli since I learned they were made of mung beans. It's so cool that noodles are made of beans. We threw some tomatoes, onions, peppers, and squash in a wok and let them cook. We also cooked some tofu and mushrooms on the side. The veggies we put in the wok started to get all mushy, so we thought it’d be a good idea to just throw everything in the blender and make it into a sauce. It was really good actually. </p>

    <p>After dinner Henry and I went to a bar. It was down the street and had a pool table. We got there and found out there was a bit of queue to play, but that's okay because they also had ring ding in the back (harder than expected). We met some folks and discussed strategy. It’s a good idea to swing the ring at a bit of an angle so that it doesn’t run into the hook, but also comes back around and falls in. It’s also a good idea to throw the ring itself at a particular angle, but that’s harder to do because it likes to spin. One guy came in and got it on his second try. He’d had a bit of practice. Henry gave it a go and it took him maybe thirty swings. I probably took twice that. It took less than ten swings on Henry’s second try. It took me less than twenty. 
    </p>
    <p>We also learned that the table was singles only and winner stays on, so actually Henry couldn’t play. I had written my name down earlier, so eventually someone called me in. I didn’t embarrass myself, but the guy I was playing against was on a hot winning streak and crushed me like a bug. </p>
    <p>Henry and I went dancing that night at a club called Bossa Nova. They always have good music, it’s usually free, and it was right down the street (win, win, win?). There was a small, middle aged, asian man hanging out and dancing. Thought nothing of him other than that he wasn’t necessarily the main demographic. Later I noticed him giving someone a bump of coke. The same person started talking to me later and explained that he shows up to all the raves. He’s the last one there. He goes out ‘til sunrise. He doesn’t even know english. But he found his scene.
